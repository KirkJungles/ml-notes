# ml-notes
This repo contains concise notes on various topics and algorithms in machine learning, and occasionally implementations of algorithms in C# and python. ML posts on Medium all started to read like long, drawn-out food recipe articles that include personal backstories, pictures of the authors cats, etc., but with no "jump to recipe" option. This is my solution to that.

I'm not yet accepting commits for new topics (this is primarily for my own studying purposes), but I'm always open to correction on existing items.
